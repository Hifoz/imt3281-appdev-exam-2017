### Exam in Application Development (IMT3281) at NTNU Gj√∏vik, 2017
My 30 hour home exam in Application Development from december 2017. Written in Java, using a derby database.

The application is a made to allow the user to look up what movies an actor has been in, and what actors has starred in a movie. 
The actor/movie data is pulled from api.themoviedb.org and cached locally in a derby database so the application won't need to fetch the data online every time the same title/name is searched.
